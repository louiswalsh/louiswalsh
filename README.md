My Current Fun Project:
- BlackTopGen 🏀
- Repo: https://github.com/louiswalsh/BlackTopGen
- When playing friends (or roommates) in NBA 2k19's Blacktop feature, you can choose a rating and # of players on each team, and the program will generate two completely balanced teams so that there will be no arguments as to who picked the better squad 
- Python/Flask API that handles the logic of creating the teams
- React/JS front end that calls the API and displays the two generated teams
